//! Eframe app that displays frames + accesskit trees streamed from an `egui_kittest` harness,
//! and lets the user pause / resume / single-step the test and inspect individual widgets.
//!
//! The binary in `src/main.rs` is the default entry point: it wires up stdin/stdout I/O, a
//! single-instance lock, and runs the eframe app. This crate also exposes [`InspectorApp`]
//! and the worker-channel types as a library so integration tests can launch the same app
//! under `egui_kittest` and feed synthetic frames through the channels.
//!
//! Architecture follows kitdiff: [`state::AppState`] owns all persistent state; UI code in
//! [`ui`] receives a read-only [`state::AppStateRef`] and dispatches [`state::Command`]s via
//! `.send(...)`. The single place state actually mutates is [`state::AppState::handle`].
