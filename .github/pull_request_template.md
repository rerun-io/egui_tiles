<!--
* Keep your PR:s small and focused.
* The PR title is what ends up in the changelog, so make it descriptive!
* If applicable, add a screenshot or gif.
* Do NOT open PR:s from your `main` branch, as that makes it hard for maintainers to test and add commits to your PR.
* Remember to run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.
* Open the PR as a draft until you have self-reviewed it and it passes CI.
* When you have addressed a PR comment, mark it as resolved.

Please be patient!

* Closes #ISSUE_NUMBER
