# kittest_inspector

Live inspector app for [`egui_kittest`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_kittest) tests.

Allows you to debug your tests by stepping through it frame-by-frame, inspecting node roles and labels
so you can know how to query widgets. You can also take control of the tested app if you need to quickly
debug something.

## Install

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/rerun-io/kittest_inspector
```

This puts `kittest_inspector` on your `PATH`. The harness launches it as a child
process and talks to it over stdin/stdout.

## Use

In a test that uses `egui_kittest` with the `inspector` feature (Pending on the [PR](https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/8119) being merged):

```sh
KITTEST_INSPECTOR=1 cargo test my_test -- --nocapture
```

Or call `.with_inspector()` on your `Harness` to opt in programmatically.

### Env vars

- `KITTEST_INSPECTOR=1` — auto-launch an inspector for every harness in this process.
- `KITTEST_INSPECTOR_PATH=/path/to/kittest_inspector` — override the binary lookup
  (by default the harness looks for `kittest_inspector` on `PATH`).

## Development

To build & run the example from this repo with an example test, you can use the following snippet:
```bash
cargo build && KITTEST_INSPECTOR=1 KITTEST_INSPECTOR_PATH=target/debug/kittest_inspector cargo test --test example_app
```
